# Image-Based Diagnostic Assistant

## Overview

The **Image-Based Diagnostic Assistant** is a cutting-edge web application designed to assist in diagnosing diseases from medical images. Utilizing advanced deep learning models, this tool provides accurate diagnostic predictions for a variety of medical conditions. The application features a user-friendly interface where medical professionals or basic users can upload images, receive predictions, and access detailed information about the diagnostic process.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload medical images (e.g., MRI, X-ray) for analysis.
- **Diagnostic Predictions**: The application provides diagnostic predictions based on the uploaded images using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Informative Pages**: The app includes informational pages such as About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, and Terms and Conditions.
- **Production-Ready**: The backend is built using Flask and Gunicorn, while the frontend is developed with React, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Medical Libraries and AI**: Integrates medical libraries and AI architectures like CNNs, U-Net, ViT, and more for enhanced diagnostic capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask, Gunicorn, Python
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI Models**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Deployment**: Docker, Heroku

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Setup Backend**:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Setup Frontend**:
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Build and Run Docker Containers**:
    ```sh
    cd ..
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

## Usage

- The frontend can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend can be accessed at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory. Ensure that the paths and settings in `config.yaml` match your setup.

### config/config.yaml
```yaml
model_path: 'models/path_to_model/model.h5'
upload_folder: 'uploads/'
allowed_extensions: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png']
```


## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- **GET /**: Home page with welcome message.
- **GET /upload**: Page to upload images.
- **POST /upload**: Endpoint to handle image uploads and return predictions.
- **GET /about**: About page with information about the application.
- **GET /contact**: Contact page for user inquiries.
- **GET /faq**: FAQ page with frequently asked questions.
- **GET /privacy**: Privacy policy page.
- **GET /terms**: Terms and conditions page.

## Example Usage

### Upload an Image

1. Navigate to the `/upload` page.
2. Select an image of a skin lesion and upload it.
3. The application will process the image and provide a diagnostic prediction.

### View Results

- After uploading, the `/result` page will display the prediction (benign or malignant) along with confidence scores.

## Future Enhancements

We have several enhancements planned for the future:

- **Model Improvements**: Continuous improvement of model accuracy through data augmentation and transfer learning.
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Development of a more interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Additional Diagnostic Tools**: Integration of more diagnostic tools and support for other types of medical images.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Making the application fully compatible with mobile devices.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Adding support for multiple languages to cater to a global audience.

## Results and Impact

The Image-Based Diagnostic Assistant has shown significant potential in assisting medical professionals with diagnostic tasks. The AI models have achieved high accuracy rates, providing reliable predictions that can aid in early detection and treatment of various medical conditions. This tool can potentially reduce the workload on healthcare providers and improve patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnoses.
